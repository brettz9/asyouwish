Version notes:

?
* API change: Require full paths for low-level APIs (as shorter versions are deprecated in the SDK)
* Usability bug fix: Ensure addon registration always enables ability to request privileges
* Usability bug fix: Ensure that allowed websites are updated whenever approved websites are updated (e.g., if user disallows a site which is an addon, causing it to trigger its unload event which can request privileges again)
* Usability bug fix: Display addon meta properties in UI
* API improvement: Remove undocumented getDefaultPrivs in favor of more functional getPossiblePrivs
* API improvement: Allow isRegistered to check version/properties
* Usability improvement: Allow 'file' protocol by default along with 'https' (because there should not be the same risk of man-in-the-middle (and it will still need to request privileges to get them))

0.4.1
* Security Bug fix: Though it did not allow other privileges without permission, the code to first confirm the user wanted to install an addon was not present
* Improvement: Avoid errors in addon unloading and isRegistered() checks

0.4

* Feature: Added privilege whitelist as an additional option to restricting request types

0.3.1

* Minor bug fix: Make "current" options empty on panel open
* Feature: Expose remaining low-level APIs
* Improvement: Retry notification in case two attempts made to open at same time

0.2
* Bug fix: Replace ugly select option expansion with CSS-based tooltip
* Feature: Add and wrap remaining high level APIs and add own custom x-namespaced-simple-storage API (a subset of simple-storage)
