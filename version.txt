Planned for 1.2.0:
* More precise control by the user or site over namespaced shared storage.

Version notes:

1.1.0
* Added beginnings of browser-in-browser demo

1.0.0
* Breaking change: Requires "sdk/" prefix on high-level APIs as per the SDK
* Internal code improvement: Remove deprecated calls within code and demos (which will hopefully help prevent conflicts but keep compatibility if SDK uses Node APIs without putting them as "SDK"!)
* Utilize SDK 1.15 (panel/widget combo is still not working, even with my mod, so using the non-modded version)

0.5.2
* FF Update: Support up to Firefox 21 (panel/widget combo is not currently working)
* Utilize SDK 1.14 including adding new SDK APIs: indexed-db, sdk/system/events, sdk/tabs/utils and removing no longer present SDK API: sdk/content/content-proxy
* Usability improvement: Include (non-localized) privileged name in request notifications along with localized message
* API addition: x-subprocess library (courtesy https://github.com/ochameau/jetpack-subprocess/ ) as available privilege and
utilize within subprocess and command line demos
* API improvement: Allow x-unload event for event about removal of privileges for normal
privileged sites.
* API fix: Restore sync API (but only allows one object to be returned)
* Internal code improvement: attempt to address some can't access dead object errors (missing windows)
* Other coding improvements

0.5
* Security improvement: Require register() calls to first be allowed to ask to serve as an addon.
* Security improvement: Allow "x-register" to be added to the enforced whitelist to allow prevention of addon registration requests
* API change: Require full paths for low-level APIs (as shorter versions are deprecated in the SDK)
* Usability bug fix: Ensure addon registration always enables ability to request privileges
* Usability bug fix: Ensure that allowed websites are updated whenever approved websites are updated (e.g., if user disallows a site which is an addon, causing it to trigger its unload event which can request privileges again)
* Usability bug fix: Display addon meta properties in UI
* API improvement: Remove undocumented getDefaultPrivs in favor of more functional getPossiblePrivs
* API improvement: Allow isRegistered to check version/properties
* API fix: Fix register() errBack execution
* Usability improvement: Allow 'file' protocol by default along with 'https' (because there should not be the same risk of man-in-the-middle (and it will still need to request privileges to get them))
* i18n: i18n-ize content scripts

0.4.1
* Security Bug fix: Though it did not allow other privileges without permission, the code to first confirm the user wanted to install an addon was not present
* Improvement: Avoid errors in addon unloading and isRegistered() checks

0.4
* Major feature: Support restartless "addon" websites (URLs invoked at startup in hidden DOM windows) including ability to request and access privileges
* Feature: Add file picker for choosing site (usable for visited or "addon" websites)
* Feature: Added privilege whitelist as an additional option to restricting request types

0.3.1
* Usability bug: Force allow all protocols to also allow all websites, and disabling of allow all websites to disable allow all protocols (radio button-like behavior)

0.3
* SDK-interaction Bug fix: Adapt SDK code to allow widget API to accept wrapped panels
* Minor bug fix: Make "current" options empty on panel open
* Feature: Expose remaining low-level APIs
* Improvement: Retry notification in case two attempts made to open at same time

0.2
* Bug fix: Replace ugly select option expansion with CSS-based tooltip
* Feature: Add and wrap remaining high level APIs and add own custom x-namespaced-simple-storage API (a subset of simple-storage)
* Feature: add getDefautPrivs() API for introspection on possible privs
* Improvement: Listen to all option changes, e.g., from Firefox's own dialog
* Improvement: Remove hard-coding of https for those who wish to disallow
* Improvement:i18n options HTML file
* Improvement: Add try-catch within callbacks in demos

0.1
* Initial release
